# Documentation
#### You can visit the official documentation here (recommended):

# How to start
### 1. Install banana-cli

```
    npm i @diegoulloao/banana-cli -g
```

### 2. Create a new project
**Replace by the name of your project**

```
    banana new project-name
```

**You can also automatically init a new git repository**

`banana new project-name --git` or `banana new project-name -g`

**Ready!**

# Configuration

### 1. Dependencies
```
    npm install
```

### 2. Database engine
**Banana-split** uses **Sequelize ORM** that supports:

* **MySQL:** `npm i mysql2`
* **MariaDB:** `npm i mariadb`
* **Postgres:** `npm i pg pg-hstore`
* **MSSQL:** `npm i tedious`
* **SQLite:** `npm i sqlite3`

**Choose to install the driver**, then at *sequelize.conf.js* and *database.conf.ts* files set your dialect.

`dialect: 'mysql' | 'mariadb' | 'postgres' | 'mssql' | 'sqlite'`

***Note: SQLite3 receives special parameters.**
Read for more information: https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html

### 3. Enviroment variables
**Rename** the _.env.example_ file located at the root of the project to _.env_ and then **set your vars.**

**Example:**

```
    # Database
    HOST=localhost
    PORT=3306

    # Auth
    DB_DATABASE=test
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=1234
```

This variables will be used by **sequelize** and **sequelize-cli** for manage your database through command line.

### 4. Database and tables
**in order to create the database you can do it manually or just run:**

```
    npx sequelize db:create
```

**Sequelize-cli** will do for you.

**(optional) After that you have to create the test table running the migration sample:**

```
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

**Now the database and user test table are created.**

### 5. Ready to dev!

#### Now run the server

```
    npm run server
```

---

# Check-in

**You can check this routes**

* **Hello:** http://localhost:3000
* **Database Auth test:** http://localhost:3000/db-auth-test
* **Database Query test:** http://localhost:3000/db-query-test

**Or just run the tests:**
